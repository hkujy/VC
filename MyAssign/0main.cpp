 	@mainpage  Traffic Assignment frameworK (TAsK)

 	The TAsK software implements several algorithms for solving the deterministic static traffic 
 	assignment problem with fixed demands, see \cite Sheffi1985, and the non-additive traffic 
 	assignment problem, see \cite Larsson2004. 

 	All code is implemented in the C++ programming language.
 	This is open-source software distributed under the MIT license.

 	The software was tested only on the Ubuntu (12.10, 13.10 and 14.04) operating system.

	## Features
	- 11 algorithms for additive traffic assignment that belong to link-, path- and bush-based
		methods, see \cite Perederieieva2015.
	- 2 algorithms for non-additive traffic assignment (path equilibration and gradient projection).
	- 2 equilibration strategies, see \cite Perederieieva2015.
	- 3 algorithms for finding a step size (bisection, Armijo-like rule and quadratic approximation).
	- Various options for direction of descent.
	- 3 flow update strategies for path-based algorithms.
	- Non-additive shortest path algorithm based on bi-objective label-setting with 
		speed-up techniques that exploit the traffic assignment structure.
	- Plain text and KML output of computation results.
 	
	## Installation instructions

	Requirements:
	- C++ compiler (the software was tested with gcc 4.8.2).
	- Boost library that can be downloaded from http://www.boost.org/.

	Instructions:
	- Download archive with source code.
	- Unzip.
	- Open terminal, go to the folder with source code (src/) and type: make.

	By default extended floating point precision is used (long double type).
	In order to use double type, comment line
	CPPFLAGS += -DUSE_EXTENDED_PRECISION in Makefile and
	recompile code if necessary by typing in terminal: make clean; make.

	\note If double type is used instead of long double, algorithms might fail to find highly precise
	solutions.
	
	## Documentation
	API documentation can be found in Docs/html/index.html.
	
	## Usage

	In order to run the TAsK software one should create a text file with various run parameters first.

	### Example data

	The archive with source code includes the SiouxFalls data instance from 
	http://www.bgu.ac.il/~bargera/tntp/. This instance can be used for
	research purposes only.

	### How to run
	
	After compiling the source code, one can run it with one of the two included parameter files. 
	Example parameter files are  
	<a href="../../input.params">input.params</a> for conventional traffic assignment
	and <a href="../../inputNonAdd.params">inputNonAdd.params</a>
	for non-additive traffic assignment. Please, use these files as templates for creating
	other files with parameters. 
	\note If some of the fields are missing or invalid values are used, the program will
	terminate with an error message or failed assertion.

	\warning All field names and possible values are case-sensitive.

	In order to run code with <a href="../../input.params">input.params</a>:
	- Open terminal and go to the folder with source code.
	- Type in terminal: ./ta ../input.params.

	File <a href="../../input.params">input.params</a> allows to solve the additive
	traffic assignment problem with the Algorithm B (for details, see \cite Dial_2006) based 
	on quadratic approximation
	for the SiouxFalls instance.

	File <a href="../../inputNonAdd.params">inputNonAdd.params</a> allows to solve the non-additive
	traffic assignment problem with the path equilibration algorithm
	 (for details, see \cite Florian1995)
	based on Newton step
	for the SiouxFalls instance.

	### Parameter files

	A parameter file must contain the following fields (supported comments \b/\b* for
	multiple line comments, \b/\b/ for one line comments):

	## Existing problems of the current implementation
	 - Excessive usage of pointers where references are more appropriate.
	 - In a few places arrays are used where vectors would be better.
	 - ObjectManager is responsible for creation of ALL objects.
	 - StarNetwork and PathBasedFlowMove iterator-like methods are not safe to use in nested loops.
