UE route flows are also quite commonly used in methodological research as well as in practical applications, even though it is well known that route flows are not uniquely determined by the UE conditions. One way to resolve this dilemma is by imposing an additional condition, such as the condition of proportionality.},

  Abstract                 = {Public policy has remained stoutly resistant to the economic profession's call to use congestion tolls to minimize the social costs from automobile congestion. This paper explores this issue by using stated preference models to estimate the value that commuters are willing to pay to save travel time. We find that this value is low and surprisingly insensitive to travel conditions and how toll revenues are used. It appears that even high-income commuters, having adjusted to congestion through their modal, residential, workplace, and departure time choices, simply do not value travel time savings enough to benefit substantially from tolls. },

For each route at each time of day and for each day of the week, the distribution of travel times across different weeks is measured using loop detector data. The best-fitting models represent travel-time by its median, and unreliability by the difference between the 90th percentile and the median. We present models of route choice both alone and combined with other choices, namely time of day, car occupancy, and installation of an electronic transponder. In our best model, containing all these choices except time of day, value of time (VOT) is $22.87 per hour, while value of reliability is $15.12 per hour for men and $31.91 for women. These values are 72%, 48%, and 101%, respectively, of the average wage rate in our sample. },

  Abstract                 = {Most traffic assignment models assume that the generalized cost experienced by a traveller making a given trip on a network results from a combination of time and money expenses that is the same for everybody. To represent with more relevance different tradeoffs between time and money, we design a model that allows for differentiating travellers by means of an attribute, ‘value-of-time’, that is continuously distributed over a real interval. After giving a formal definition of the cost versus time equilibrium, we characterize it as a solution of a convex extremal program, before showing that there exists a unique cost versus time equilibrium. We then design an algorithm to compute this equilibrium. We use it to carry on a small numerical experiment that emphasizes the importance of considering continuously distributed values-of-time in the evaluation of toll highway projects. },

The maximum entropy UE route flow is an example of the last. On the other hand, a UE route flow arbitrarily generated in a standard traffic assignment procedure may not bear such continuity property, as demonstrated by an example in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the problem of finding all Pareto-optimal solutions for the multi-criteria single-source shortest-path problem with nonnegative edge lengths. The standard approaches are generalizations of label-setting (Dijkstra) and label-correcting algorithms, in which the distance labels are multi-dimensional and more than one distance label is maintained for each node. The crucial parameter for the run time and space consumption is the total number of Pareto optima. In general, this value can be exponentially large in the input size. However, in various practical applications one can observe that the input data has certain characteristics, which may lead to a much smaller number — small enough to make the problem efficiently tractable from a practical viewpoint. In this paper, we identify certain key characteristics, which occur in various applications. These key characteristics are evaluated on a concrete application scenario (computing the set of best train connections in view of travel time, fare, and number of train changes) and on a simplified randomized model, in which these characteristics occur in a very purist form. In the applied scenario, it will turn out that the number of Pareto optima on each visited node is restricted by a small constant. To counter-check the conjecture that these characteristics are the cause of these uniformly positive results, we will also report negative results from another application, in which these characteristics do not occur.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Traffic congestion is an issue in most cities worldwide. Transportation engineers and urban planners develop various traffic management projects in order to solve this issue. One way to evaluate such projects is traffic assignment (TA). The goal of \{TA\} is to predict the behaviour of road users for a given period of time (morning and evening peaks, for example). Once such a model is created, it can be used to analyse the usage of a road network and to predict the impact of implementing a potential project. The most commonly used \{TA\} model is known as user equilibrium, which is based on the assumption that all drivers minimise their travel time or generalised cost. In this study, we consider the static deterministic user equilibrium \{TA\} model. The constant growth of road networks and the need of highly precise solutions (required for select link analysis, network design, etc.) motivate researchers to propose numerous methods to solve this problem. Our study aims to provide a recommendation on what methods are more suitable depending on available computational resources, time and requirements on the solution. In order to achieve this goal, we implement a flexible software framework that maximises the usage of common code and, hence, ensures comparison of algorithms on common ground. In order to identify similarities and differences of the methods, we analyse groups of algorithms that are based on common principles. In addition, we implement and compare several different methods for solving sub-problems and discuss issues related to accumulated numerical errors that might occur when highly accurate solutions are required.},

  Abstract                 = {Shortest path problems appear as subproblems in numerous optimization problems. In most papers concerning multiple objective shortest path problems, additivity of the objective is a de-facto assumption, but in many real-life situations objectives and criteria, can be non-additive. The purpose of this paper is to give a general framework for dominance tests for problems involving a number of non-additive criteria. These dominance tests can help to eliminate paths in a dynamic programming framework when using multiple objectives. Results on real-life multi-objective problems containing non-additive criteria are reported. We show that in many cases the framework can be used to efficiently reduce the number of generated paths.},

  Abstract                 = {Real applications in shift scheduling often require handling rules such as multiple breaks, flexible shift lengths, overtime, multiple activities, among others. Because these rules demand a high level of flexibility, we model the problem as a Multi-Activity Shift Scheduling Problem (MASSP), where multiple activities can be scheduled in a shift. To solve the MASSP, we propose a column generation-based approach. The auxiliary problem is modeled as a Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (SPPRC), where most difficult constraints are embedded in the underlying graph. To illustrate the solution approach, we present our experience solving a real-world problem from a large parking lot operator that schedules security staff and cashiers among several parking lots in Bogotá (Colombia). The results show a significant reduction on the staffing total costs and on man-hours used.},

The algorithm transforms the original graph into extended one using the set of forbidden paths and finds a path (that might contain cycles) without forbidden paths from a given origin to evey other node. It seems that I cannot apply this approach to bi-objective shortest path. Important: the elementary k-shortest paths problem can be solved in polynomial time (Lawler, 1972), but the elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints is NP-hard in the strong sense (Dror, 1994).},

Multiple objectives have been considered at either the upper or lower level in the literature but not both. We consider three objectives at the upper level: minimising system travel time; total vehicle emissions; and negative health impacts, modelled as the level of pollutant uptake. For the lower level, we adopt a time surplus maximisation bi-objective user equilibrium model, assuming all users have two objectives: minimising travel time and toll. The complete bilevel optimisation problem is solved using a combination of a metaheuristic and a classical optimisation algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model route choice behaviour in a tolled road network with a bi-objective approach, assuming that all users have two objectives: (1) minimise travel time; and (2) minimise toll cost. We assume further that users have different preferences in the sense that for any given path with a specific toll, there is a limit on the time that an individual would be willing to spend. Different users can have different preferences represented by this indifference curve between toll and time. Time surplus is defined as the maximum time minus the actual time. Given a set of paths, the one with the highest (or least negative) time surplus will be the preferred path for the individual. This will result in a bi-objective equilibrium solution satisfying the time surplus maximisation bi-objective user equilibrium (TSmaxBUE) condition. That is, for each O–D pair, all individuals are travelling on the path with the highest time surplus value among all the efficient paths between this O–D pair. We show that the \{TSmaxBUE\} condition is a proper generalisation of user equilibrium with generalised cost function, and that it is equivalent to bi-objective user equilibrium. We also present a multi-user class version of the \{TSmaxBUE\} condition and demonstrate our concepts with illustrative examples. },
